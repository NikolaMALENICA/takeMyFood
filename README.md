# takeMyFood

This project has for main goal to allow people to sell food that they've coocked.
Anyone can buy from them and they can put the price they want on their products.

You can follow cooks to make it easier to choose when you connect to the app (similar to a social network)
There is a history of your last orders so you can ask for more food to a particular cook
You can also access to random propositions of sellers to try some new things regularly.

A system of notation is available to ensure that :
  - the price is fine with the quality of the product
  - the reliability of the seller (the person is on time, what he sells is acctually what he gives, etc)
  - the buyer is reliable
